I specialises in the fund management sector and have extensive experience gained from the audits of both funds and fund managers. I have been the manager-in-charge of a US$5 billion private real estate fund, reporting under US GAAP, since its inception in 2013, till present. I have therefore led my team through the full span of a fund’s life cycle, from inception and drawdowns, to investing and valuation, to divestment and distributions, including carry distributions. I also manage the onshore portfolio real estate investee companies and offshore SPVs audit for the fund family. These report under SFRS/IFRS, and number about 30-40 in any given year. I can therefore say I have strong experience in all aspects of fund financial reporting and handling large reporting volumes.
Besides real estate funds, I have also audited private equity funds, venture capital funds, infrastructure funds, and hedge funds, as well as the related fund managers, including those regulated under the SFA.
In addition to my primary role as audit manager within the financial services sector, another current aspect of my role is providing accounting technical support to nonfinancial sector companies’ audits. For example, every quarter, I review the hedges of a SGX-listed company to provide clearance for hedge accounting in accordance financial instrument standards IAS39/FRS 39 and IFRS 9/FRS 109. I have therefore deep technical knowledge of the accounting standards, especially those relating to investment entities and financial instruments.
Other major audits that I have handled as manager-in-charge includes: a SGX-listed stockbroker, a wholesale bank, commodity trading firm. Besides audit, I have also led other significant projects such as regulatory compliance advisory, MAS inspection remediation review, and accounting advisory.
I have consistently achieve the top two rating bands in my firms since I was an associate. As part of my professional development, I worked in the Deloitte New York firm for an entire peak period, during which I worked on the audit of a Fortune 500 investment manager. I also passed Level 3 of the CFA exams in 2013.
I am open to roles which would further my professional development as a financial reporting and accounting specialist within the investment management sector.Telephone         (852) 9256 4669 Email                 jacklth@hotmail.com Qualification Summary.

2011 CPA Australia Excellence Award for academic excellence in Curtin University of Technology – Bachelor of Commerce (Accounting & Finance).Currently employed in The Xander Group as a Fund Accountant, and was previously a Fund Accounting Manager in SS&C GlobeOp. (Previously known as Citibank Private Equity Singapore, “CPES”, prior to the acquisition).
Being in the Private Equity fund administration services for 3 years, I have had the opportunity to manage various funds up to $1.6b in fund size. Having the exposure to Master, Co-Invest and Carry entities during the early stage of my career in CPES allows me to confidently guide and lead my teammates while I transition to the reviewer role. I have also successfully lead the migration of our in-house accounting system to Investran. I am diligent and disciplined. When in doubt, I prefer to work my way through and dig into the background knowledge.
My current role in Xander Investment Management (buy side) allows me to gain additional exposure to roles and responsibility which would not have been possible if I were to remain in the fund administration services. To name a few, Determination of investment valuation based on asset managers’ estimation and valuation report, Coordination with deal teams relating to funding of investment and Filing of local corporate and tax matters.
Cumulatively, these experiences allows me have a better understanding of how the Private Equity industry works, from the start of fund sourcing to calculation of incentive fees and ultimately, preparation of proforma distribution prior to end of life of fund.
I strongly believe that these compelling values of mine will be of great benefit in aiding my future career in the asset/investment management, thereby allowing me to serve the organisation for the better good.
