Computer skills: Advanced Excel certificate, financial modeling on Excel, SAP, Oracle Hyperion, SPSS.Investments have always been a major part of my life. When I was a young boy, I would help my father report the price of Comfort share from Teletext. From then on, there was no looking back. I took the Diploma in Banking & Financial Services from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, graduated not only with a Diploma with Merit (awarded to top 5% of the cohort), I was the Gold Medallist (award to the top student of the cohort).
In Nanyang Technological University, while studying the Degree of Bachelor of Business (Applied Economics), my grades took a hit while I was President of the Hall of Residence 5. Hence, I only managed to graduate with a Second Class Honours (Lower Division). With that, the opportunity to work in the field of investments was close to nil as the competition is stiff and not only grades are looked upon, but the pedigree of the university as well.
As such, I worked as a fund accountant, starting in the traditional fund side, officially moving to the alternative investment (hedge fund) fund accounting in my second year at Citibank. I moved to my present firm, Sansar Capital Asia Pte. Ltd. in 2012. The yearning of being involved in investments did not disappear.
My financial advisor was the person looking after my portfolio of unit trusts. However I felt that the level of service provided by her did not commensurate with the fees that was paid which impacted the returns of the funds. Thus, I shifted my funds out from her and did it on my own through the Fundsupermart platform. I’m enclosing the screenshot of the performance of the funds since 2014. The annualised return is [1+(6,067.25/59,499.61)]1/3 – 1 = 0.0329.
I understand that I may not have the required hands-on the job experience of serving HNW or UHNW clients. However, I do believe that with a passion for investments and an eager to learn, obstacles can be overcomed.
